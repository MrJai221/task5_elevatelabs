# Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

This project involves capturing and analyzing live network traffic to identify basic protocols and traffic patterns.

## Objective

The main objective of this task is to gain hands-on experience with packet analysis using Wireshark and to develop an awareness of common network protocols.

## Tools Used

*   **Wireshark:** A free and open-source packet analyzer.
*   **VMware:** Used to host the Linux virtual machine.
*   **Linux (Ubuntu):** The operating system used for the analysis.

## Methodology

1.  **Setup:** Wireshark was installed and configured on a Linux VM.
2.  **Packet Capture:** Live network traffic was captured for a period of [Specify Duration, e.g., 5 minutes]. The resulting packet capture file is `[Your .pcap file name]`.
3.  **Analysis:** The captured packets were analyzed to identify the different protocols and communication streams present in the network traffic.

## Protocols Identified

During the analysis, the following protocols were identified:

*   **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** [Briefly describe what you observed, e.g., Handled the majority of the web browsing traffic.]
*   **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** [Briefly describe what you observed, e.g., Primarily used for DNS queries.]
*   **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure):** [Briefly describe what you observed, e.g., Traffic to various websites was observed.]
*   **DNS (Domain Name System):** [Briefly describe what you observed, e.g., Queries and responses for domain name resolution were frequent.]
*   **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** [Briefly describe what you observed, e.g., Generated by the 'ping' command to test network connectivity.]
*   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** [Briefly describe what you observed, e.g., Used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses on the local network.]
*   *(Add any other protocols you identified)*

## Outcome

This project provided practical skills in network traffic capture and analysis. It enhanced my understanding of how different protocols work together to enable network communication.

## How to View the Packet Capture

The packet capture file (`[ .pcap file name]`) can be opened and analyzed using Wireshark.
